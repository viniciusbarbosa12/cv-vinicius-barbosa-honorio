## About Me

I'm a Full Stack Developer with 8+ years of experience building scalable, secure, and high-performance applications across fintech, government, B2B, and agribusiness.  
I specialize in full-stack development with .NET (C#), Angular, and React, always applying clean architecture, SOLID principles, and a strong focus on production-grade code.  

I've worked on complex, distributed systems in cloud-native environments (Azure & AWS) using Azure Functions, Kafka, SQS, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and MongoDB. On the frontend, I build responsive web and cross-platform mobile apps using Angular, React, and React Native.  

In DevOps and observability, I have hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps), ARM templates, Docker, and tools like Application Insights, Grafana, Prometheus, CloudWatch, and OpenTelemetry.  

I thrive in remote, international teams, communicating in English daily and collaborating across time zones to deliver business-critical software. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through clean code, deep collaboration, and full visibility from commit to production.

## Professional Experience

> **Pilkington â€“ Full Stack Developer**  
Remote | Sept 2024 â€“ Present  

I work in a global, fully remote engineering team where English is used daily to collaborate across multiple time zones. We're responsible for building and maintaining business-critical web applications used by different regions of the company.

In this role, I design and deliver scalable, maintainable, and observable full-stack solutions using .NET and Angular. Iâ€™ve led key initiatives such as implementing real-time features with SignalR, background jobs with Hangfire, and performance-optimized SQL Server modeling. On the frontend, I build modular Angular components using lazy loading, code splitting, and efficient change detection strategies.

I manage CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps and provision infrastructure using Docker and ARM templates. I also develop serverless applications with Azure Functions to handle scheduled and event-driven workloads.

On the observability front, I integrated Application Insights, Serilog, and OpenTelemetry, and built dashboards and alerts in Azure Monitor and Grafana.
These efforts improved system reliability, reduced incident resolution time by over 40%, and enabled faster, safer deployments across our distributed environment.

> **ItaÃº Unibanco â€“ Full Stack Developer**  
Remote | Mar 2022 â€“ Sept 2024  

At Brazilâ€™s largest private bank, I worked on two strategic initiatives to modernize legacy systems and build scalable, cloud-native platforms. I contributed across the full stack in distributed microservices projects, collaborating with multidisciplinary teams in a fast-paced environment.

On the Legal Entities Web Portal, I developed backend and frontend components using Node.js, Spring Boot, Angular, and PostgreSQL, deploying to AWS EC2 with automated CI/CD via CodePipeline. I implemented centralized logging and observability using Splunk and CloudWatch, creating dashboards and alert rules to enable real-time diagnosis and improve stability.

In this project, I reported directly to an international architecture and governance team, using English in weekly syncs, documentation, and alignment with external partners, which required clarity and precision in technical communication.

In the Stock Valuation System, I developed backend services in .NET Core and Angular using an event-driven architecture with Kafka and AWS SQS. I led infrastructure optimizations on ECSâ€”including cold start mitigation, auto-scaling tuning, and health check configurationâ€”which improved system responsiveness and reliability under load.
These initiatives improved availability, reduced latency, and accelerated deployment cycles. They also strengthened my skills in distributed architectures, messaging systems, infrastructure-as-code, and effective cross-border collaboration.

Technologies: .NET Core, Angular, Node.js, Spring Boot, Kafka, AWS ECS/EC2, SQS, PostgreSQL, MySQL Aurora, CloudWatch, Splunk, CodePipeline.

> **Bluemond â€“ Full Stack Developer**  
Brazil | May 2021 â€“ Mar 2022  

Worked across fintech, administrative, and B2B platforms in remote-first, collaborative teams, delivering full-stack solutions that supported real-world business operations at scale.

On the backend, I developed RESTful services using C# .NET Core and Node.js, with deep involvement in relational database modeling and performance tuning in SQL Server and PostgreSQL. On the frontend, I engineered modern React and Next.js interfaces, applying component-based architecture and writing robust unit and integration tests with Jest and React Testing Library.

In the DevOps space, I managed CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, enforced code quality with SonarQube, and maintained automated build and release flows across environments. I also worked hands-on with cloud-native infrastructure, provisioning resources with ARM templates and CloudFormation, building scalable, event-driven workloads using AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, and implementing asynchronous communication with Kafka and SQS.

These experiences strengthened my ability to deliver production-ready systems with a strong focus on performance, maintainability, and observability, while operating confidently across multi-cloud platforms and the full software delivery lifecycle.

> **Grupo Rehagro â€“ Full Stack Developer**  
Brazil | Oct 2019 â€“ May 2021  

Took part in the development of a large-scale agriculture management system built from the ground up to support nationwide operations. I contributed across the full stack, implementing business logic and REST APIs with C# .NET Core, and building modern, responsive user interfaces with ReactJS. I also designed and maintained PostgreSQL databases, ensuring data integrity, performance, and scalability.

The solution was deployed on Azure through streamlined CI/CD pipelines, which I helped configure and maintain to enable fast, consistent releases. I worked closely with cross-functional stakeholders to clarify requirements, improve delivery workflows, and ensure quality throughout the software lifecycle.

By the end of my time on the project, we had successfully released a stable version to production, which began to be widely adopted by users across different regions. The system received strong positive feedback from clients, especially for its performance, usability, and reliability.
